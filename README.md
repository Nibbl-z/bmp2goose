# bmp2goose

This is a command line interface that converts bitmap (.bmp) files into the file format that one of my previous projects, [Goose Platformer](https://github.com/Nibbl-z/goose-platformer), uses for custom levels (.goose).

### Running

1. Prebuilt executable: Download the .exe file from releases, and run it.
2. Build from source: Download the source code, install rust, and run `cargo run` 

### Usage

1. Select a bitmap file
2. Select a location to export the .goose file
3. Enter the size you want for each pixel
4. Enter the X offset
5. Enter the Y offset
6. If you have exported your .goose file to somewhere other than the Goose Platformer save directory, then move it there (AppData/goose-platformer)
7. Enjoy!!!
